I build scalable computational approaches to infer genomes from DNA sequencing data.
My work on this topic began with the development of Bayesian methods to detect and genotype genomic variants, with application of these methods to the thousands of human genomes cataloged in the 1000 Genomes Project.
Lessons learned in that effort guided me to work on unbiased methods for genome inference based on graphical models of pangenomes.
In these, the genome is encoded in a graph that may represent a population sample of individuals from the same species, a metagenome, the diploid genome of a single individual, or any other useful collection of genomic sequence information.
I have shown that this approach provides more accurate alignment of reads when it is possible to construct a high-quality pangenome.
%.%, and am currently exploring applications of this method.
%and that graphical models suitable 

I develop and share my source code publicly (\url{https://github.com/ekg}) under permissive open licenses.
